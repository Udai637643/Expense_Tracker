# Expense Tracker Application

## Project Overview
The **Expense Tracker Application** is a full-stack web application designed to allow users to record, edit, delete, and visualize their expenses. The application provides a user-friendly interface and allows users to track their spending patterns through interactive charts and graphs.

### Features:
- Add, edit, and delete expense records.
- Visualize expenses through various charts.
- Responsive and intuitive user interface.
- Clean and maintainable code structure.
- (Optional) User authentication for multiple users.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- **Visualization**: Chart.js (for rendering charts)
- **Authentication** (Optional): JWT (JSON Web Token)

---

## Requirements

### Backend
The backend is built using **Node.js** and **Express.js** to handle API requests. The backend exposes the following endpoints:

- **POST /expenses**: Add a new expense.
- **GET /expenses**: Retrieve all expenses.
- **PUT /expenses/:id**: Update an existing expense.
- **DELETE /expenses/:id**: Delete an expense.

### Frontend
The frontend is built with **React.js** and is designed to be fully responsive. It includes:

- A form to add and edit expense records.
- A list to display expenses with options to edit or delete.
- A dashboard to visualize expenses (pie chart for category distribution, bar chart for monthly expenses).

### Database
The application uses **MongoDB** (or **PostgreSQL**) to store expense data. Each expense record includes the following fields:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for each expense record.
- **Amount**: Amount of the expense.
- **Category**: Category of the expense (e.g., food, transportation, etc.).
- **Description**: A brief description of the expense.
- **Date**: The date when the expense was incurred.

## Project Setup

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/expense-tracker.git
   cd expense-tracker/backend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Set up environment variables for MongoDB (or PostgreSQL). Create a .env file in the backend folder with the following content:

ini
Copy
Edit
DB_URI=your-database-uri
PORT=5000
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../frontend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Start the frontend server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Open the frontend application in your browser (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

You can:

Add an expense by filling out the form and clicking the "Add Expense" button.

Edit an expense by clicking the "Edit" button next to an expense.

Delete an expense by clicking the "Delete" button next to an expense.

View the dashboard to see visualizations of your expenses by category and month.

Screenshots
Here are some screenshots of the application in action:

Optional Features
User Authentication: Implement JWT-based authentication to allow multiple users to track their expenses separately.

Data Export: Provide users with the ability to export their expenses as CSV or PDF files.

Evaluation Criteria
Code Quality: Adherence to coding standards, clean and modular architecture.

Functionality: Implementation of all required features (Add, Edit, Delete, Visualize).

User Experience: Design and usability of the frontend interface.

Visualization: Clear and accurate representation of expense data in charts.

Bonus Points: Implementation of user authentication or other innovative features.

Installation and Running
